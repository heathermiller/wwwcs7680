title: Send me your CCS usernames by Wednesday
---

If you wish to get credit for the first assignment, I need to have received your
CCS username in my inbox by Wednesday so I can add you to the [course GitHub
repository](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/heather/cs7680).

Remember, **this week only, your writeup is due by 12pm on Thursday September
15th** as a pull request to the [course GitHub
repository](https://github.ccs.neu.edu/heather/cs7680).
