title: Tips for reading and writing
---

I mentioned last week in class that I had a few pointers what sorts of questions
to ask yourself when reading a research paper that may help you in writing your
weekly analysis.

It turns out that this information has always been on the [Reading Research
Papers]({{ site.baseurl }}/reading-papers.html) page.

In particular, Michael Mitzenmacher has some [good advice and tips on what to
ask yourself when reading
papers](https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/ReadPaper.pdf), which
you may find useful!

William Griswold has prepared [a form of good questions to ask
yourself](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~wgg/CSE210/paperform.pdf) which you may find
helpful.
